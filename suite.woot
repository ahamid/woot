# Comments begin with '#'

# Here we can list the directories/files where the tests .ooc files should be found
tests/

# Woot will compile+launch them one by one, recursively
# And display a tree with [ ok ] and [FAIL] colored in red and green
# and totalize the failed tests, the passed tests, and the total number of tests
# Then each failed test will have its .log file with the ooc error message
