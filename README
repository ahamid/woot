woot is a unit testing system written in ooc.

When feature-complete, it will be used as the official unit
testing system of the ooc compiler test suite.

Governing principles:
  * File-based
  * For each test, can specify "should compile (or not)", with which error message,
  "should run (or not)", "should segfault", "should throw exception"
  * Generate nice text (commandline) summaries, HTML summaries, etc. Possibility
  to maintain a history of failed/passed tests.
